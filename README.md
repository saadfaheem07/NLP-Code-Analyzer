This project analyzes Python code using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It preprocesses code into structured data, trains a model, evaluates performance, and visualizes results.

Project Files:

- main.py – Main entry point to train and evaluate the model  
- preprocess.py – Preprocesses raw dataset into features and labels  
- expand.py – Expands datasets by extracting valid AST entries  
- some_module.py – Helper functions for model training and evaluation  
- plot_figures.py – Generates graphs (PR curve, ROC curve, feature importances)  
- test.py – Utility scripts for testing and inspecting datasets  

How to Run:

Preprocess the dataset:

   python preprocess.py

Train and evaluate:

 python main.py

Plot results:

 python plot_figures.py
